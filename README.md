# How To Use
## Compiling
##### REQUIRES LINUX TO COMPILE

_Ubuntu is reccomended, but look at the wiki to get info on dependencies to build._

Remember: if your username is root, do not use sudo, or it will not work.

```
sudo apt-get install nasm
sudo apt-get install qemu
sudo apt-get install qemu-system
sudo apt-get install gcc
sudo apt-get install nano
```

Once you have ran all of those commands, (supposing you had no errors, but if you did, [fix them here](https://github.com/EnderSlayer6792/EnderOS/wiki/Fixing-Errors))
